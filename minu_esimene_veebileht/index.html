                <p class="content-text">Mustard Service is an indie rock band based in Miami, Florida, formed in 2015. Self-described as "zest-pop", the band's music draws influence from rock, surf, jazz, funk, and bossa nova.</p>
                <h3 class="content-title">Members</h3>
                <p class="content-text">The band consists of Marco Rivero Ochoa on lead vocals and rhythm guitar, Gabriel Marinuchi (or "Nuchi") on lead guitar, Augusto "Tuto" Di Catarina on bass, Leo Cattani on keyboard, and Adam Peresz on drums, who replaced former drummer and producer Armando Baeza after the band's first album.</p>
                <h3 class="content-title">Styles and influences</h3>
                <p class="content-text">The band's music contains elements drawn from a variety of genres, including jazz, funk, surf and R&B, but is most often described as indie rock or indie pop; the band calls their own genre "zest pop". Reviewers often decribe their music as "beachy", and the band cites the Beach Boys as their main influence. Rivero also lists the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Mac DeMarco, and Mild High Club as some of his inspirations.</p>
                <p class="content-text">Mustard Service's members all have Latin heritage and speak some amount of Spanish, and the band frequently uses elements from Latin music, in particular, bossa nova, in their songs. The song "Pleasantries (With Your Lover)", for example, uses a Latin-style groove. The band also performs songs with lyrics in Spanish, such as "Hijo de Pap√°", which appears on the album "C'est La Vie".</p>
